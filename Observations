STM with settings high_sim = x and low_sim = x 
The system plays it safe, it is very sensitive to small descrepencies and therefore will choice to adapt to any small
deviations from what it is used to, but it uses previous information to adapt which allows it to find a solution quickly.

Change settings so it is less senstive to small decrepencies. This time STM will choice to use to just use a pre-existing 
solution without associative adaptation.

Reoccurance 1 - Test of reoccurance
Reoccurance 1_2 - same as reccurance 1 with a gate, this is test of memeory association

Idea to show association would be to look at the weights of model that used a memory to its adaption. The agents weights 
should be noticably simular to memory solutions weights than randomly init weights. just pot all the value of the 
weight in scatter plot

Test this way - run the STM on 2 level the first levl will be used as a memeory and the second level will use the 1t level
as an associative anchor. Run the STM on level 2 for one iteration, get the winning solution and its weights. INSTEAD
MAYBE FIND the comparison weights using random search get a 100 solutions that work by randomly search the weight 
space randomly. Average these or let it form a cloud. yes use random 

Then run the test using the STM another x (maybe like 100-1000) times, collect the weight values of the best agent for 
that initaisation. 

Do the same using a GA that uses random init for the first iteration 

Averge the weight value forthe target weight distribution against the STM and GA the plot them against each other.
The memory based weights should be closer to the random solutions more often than the GA with just one iteration
