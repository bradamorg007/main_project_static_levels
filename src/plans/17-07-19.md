# PLAN

# 1.) VAE considers seen and unseen data to look very simular, it doesnt really cluster them apart when trained on both.
      This works on MNIST i belive because the classes even tho they share simularities are different enough for nice clustering
      
      Need to find some way to make seen and unseen classes more distinct. possible have unseen blocks differ in width and 
      make the gap size different to that of the seen blocks. 
      
# 2.) DO PROJECT USING MNIST
      
      Mnist is well structured, easy to use and interpret in the latent space. Yes its supervised but it could be learned
      using a gentic algo. So could use a population of feedfoward networks their goal is to minimise their error 
      during classification. The simulation will end when a certain accuracy level is reached so the first net to get over
      97% consistently for x number of epochs. Could use mnist_test data set as that is 10k which is more easy to work with when 
      all population has to processes each sample. 
      
      When network is presented mnist digits in a biased fashion say all ones first, this is gunna lead to the same 
      catastrophic forgetting as in the game sim. ANd the AE for MNIST will show more interpretable and managable 
      distinctions between information it knows and does not know. 
      
      All though mnist can be learned supervised, both genetic algos and gradient decent based nets would struggle to adapt
      to a non-shuffled dataset where data exposure is biased to one class. My model may overcome this, mnist will provide
      a good example or proof of concept of the point. then if i have time I can show how it can be applied to a game simualtion
      
      I think i could build this alot quicker Gunna try tamorrow
