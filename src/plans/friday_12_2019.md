# PLAN FOR TODAY

1.) As of now the VAE works on the captured data...i think. I have tried it using data its trained on and the VAE can reproduce
    the input with low loss. how ever if you train it on data that has slight jitter the model tries to generalise its 
    reconstructions so some simular geometric shapes will have fuzzyness. 
    
    The latent space of has big gaps in it, which is not continous. But i dont think i really care about that as im not 
    using Autoencoders as generators.
    
    This leads me to believe that VAE is not needed. maybe using a convolutional autoencoder instead would be just fine.
    Although i do remember VAE trained lot faster with lower loss than just a normal autoencoder with the same topology.
    Still its work a try. 
    
    PLAN: Adapt the lab file to work with my data so I can view the latent space. needs to work normal autoencoders and 
          VAEs. 
          
          Class called autoencoder
                       Then have define VAE model 
                       define CONV model
                       define fully connected Model
